## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind-CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I Learned

- After completing the project, I did research on dynamic classes on tailwind. Mostly users says use [TwMerge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge). I dropped a stackoverflow link below.

### Continued development

-Need to improve my dynamic tailwind css classes code.
-When you select a quiz title on landing page, i write the title in the header. At this point i used search params and reimport the data and find the quiz title. This is ok but it is not best practice.
